# Title
Note Taker and Organizer

# Descprition
We were tasked with building the back end for an application that already had the front end part done. The back end part included created the server.js file and creating the get and post routes for the array we were using as our database. We also had to create get routes for our two html files that were given in our starter code. The front end part of the application allows the users to add notes and save them to a list of notes that were already loaded onto the screen.

# Assignment Tasks
1. When the user logs into the application they are given a landing page where they can click a link to go the page with the notes
2. The notes page has all of the presaved notes on the lefthand column. The reight hand column has a space where the client can add notes to the note tracker and save those notes on the left hand column
3. After typing in the note and its text in the right hand column an icon appears in the top right corner that allows the user to save the notes to the notes in the left hand column
4. The user is able to click a plus icon to start writing down a new note and the text that is associated with it

# Tasks Achieved By:
I was able to achieve the tasks by reviewing the module and assimilating the concepts to what we were asked to do. I was also able to use past challenges for reference as well when it came to creating the readme file. Staying on course for today was also a big help in getting this assignment done
